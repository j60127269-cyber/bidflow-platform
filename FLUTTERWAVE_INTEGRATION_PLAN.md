# 🚀 Flutterwave Integration Plan: Authentication & Onboarding Flow

## 📋 Current Status Assessment

### ✅ **What's Already Working**
- **Authentication**: Email/password + Google OAuth
- **Onboarding Flow**: 4-step process with subscription step
- **Flutterwave Integration**: Complete backend + frontend
- **Database Schema**: All tables and RLS policies
- **Payment Flow**: Initialize → Pay → Verify → Activate

### 🔄 **Integration Points to Verify**

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Authentication Flow Enhancement**

### 1.1 User Registration Flow
```
Register → Create Profile → Onboarding → Subscription → Dashboard
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Registration creates user in Supabase Auth
- ✅ Profile creation happens during onboarding
- ✅ Subscription step is the final onboarding step
- ✅ Dashboard access requires active subscription

### 1.2 Login Flow
```
Login → Check Subscription Status → Dashboard/Onboarding
```

**Enhancement Needed:**
- Check if user has completed onboarding
- Check subscription status on login
- Redirect appropriately based on status

## 🎯 **Phase 2: Onboarding Flow Optimization**

### 2.1 Step-by-Step Flow
1. **Welcome** (`/onboarding/welcome`)
   - User introduction and value proposition
   - Progress indicator

2. **Preferences** (`/onboarding/preferences`)
   - Industry selection
   - Contract value ranges
   - Business information

3. **Notifications** (`/onboarding/notifications`)
   - Email preferences
   - WhatsApp integration
   - Alert frequency

4. **Subscription** (`/onboarding/subscription`) ⭐
   - Plan selection (Professional: 30,000 UGX/month)
   - Flutterwave payment integration
   - Success/failure handling

### 2.2 Data Persistence
- Save preferences to `profiles` table
- Save notification settings
- Create subscription record after payment

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Payment Flow Integration**

### 3.1 Payment Process
```
1. User clicks "Subscribe Now"
2. Initialize payment with Flutterwave
3. Redirect to Flutterwave payment page
4. User completes payment
5. Webhook updates payment status
6. Create/update subscription
7. Redirect to dashboard
```

### 3.2 Error Handling
- Payment failures
- Network issues
- Webhook failures
- Subscription activation failures

## 🎯 **Phase 4: Dashboard Access Control**

### 4.1 Subscription-Based Access
- **Active Subscription**: Full dashboard access
- **Trial Period**: Limited access with upgrade prompts
- **No Subscription**: Redirect to subscription page

### 4.2 Feature Gating
- **Free Features**: Basic contract browsing
- **Premium Features**: Advanced search, analytics, tracking

## 🎯 **Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements**

### 5.1 Onboarding Improvements
- Progress indicators
- Skip options for non-critical steps
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear value propositions

### 5.2 Payment Experience
- Multiple payment methods
- Clear pricing display
- Security assurances
- Support contact information
